# üé† Leetcode Carnival

[![My LeetCode stats](https://leetcode-stats-six.vercel.app/api?username=sallyklpoon&theme=dark)](https://github.com/KnlnKS/leetcode-stats)

This repository is a record of my LeetCode Python solutions.

All if not most of my solutions may include:
* a brute force method, usually with the function name ending in `_bf`
* a (hopefully) optimized method
* Time Complexity of each solution
* Space Complexity of each solution
* Notes at the top on my thought process

## üé™ The Plan
I try to tackle LeetCode dailies right now, to randomize my selection of questions between Easy to Medium and with different types of data structures. This is especially helpful in-between studying for school.

I typically time-block myself for questions -- spending at most 1h. If I do not make any progress in the hour, I will look at some discussion posts to get a hint to nudge me on the right way. I then try to implement using the hint and how I can apply this hint as a solution. Finally, if I truly cannot solve the problem, I will skim some possible solutions and implementations quickly then try to implement the concept myself.

## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Suggestions?
If you have any suggestions or comments about my solutions, feel free to reach out! I'm always learning and am very enthused by self-improvement and I know I'm not perfect. :)

# 🎠 Leetcode Carnival

This repository is a record of my LeetCode Python solutions.

All if not most of my solutions may include:
* a Brute Force method, usually with the function name ending in `_bf`
* a (hopefully) optimized method
* Time Complexity of each solution
* Space Complexity of each solution
* Notes at the top on my thought process

## 🎪 The Plan
Most of the time (right now, during school), I am randomizing my Easy selection of problems.

The plan is to eventually spend some time tackling Mediums too!

## 🎢 Stats
*bc widgets are cool*

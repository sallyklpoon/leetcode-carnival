# üé† Leetcode Carnival

This repository is a record of my LeetCode Python solutions.

All if not most of my solutions may include:
* a brute force method, usually with the function name ending in `_bf`
* a (hopefully) optimized method
* Time Complexity of each solution
* Space Complexity of each solution
* Notes at the top on my thought process

## üé™ The Plan
I try to tackle LeetCode dailies right now, to randomize my selection of questions between Easy to Medium and with different types of data structures. This is especially helpful in-between studying for school.

I typically time-block myself for questions -- spending at most 1h. If I do not make any progress in the hour, I will skim some possible solutions and implementations quickly then try to implement the concept myself.

My process is to read the question, then comment at the top with my thought process, thinking to myself. I often try to think about an optimized solution and implement first, but if I'm really stuck, I will attempt to implement at least a brute force method.

## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Suggestions?
If you have any suggestions or comments about my solutions, feel free to reach out! I'm always learning and am very enthused by self-improvement and I know I'm not perfect. :)
